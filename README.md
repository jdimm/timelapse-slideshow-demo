This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Example:  Blooming Sunflowers

  http://13.90.210.214:3000/timelapse/816a263e7954a5ceb4cc608f61a89640


## Timelapse as Slideshow

Timelapse is a kind of video, but there are advantages to implementing it as a javascript slideshow.

- no build time
- flexible image selection
- easy and immediate video scrubbing

## Files that matter in this repo

- components/Slideshow.js has all the code
- data/slides.js has the list of source images for the demo
- public/photos contains the source image files


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
